A recruitment task that I undertook.

the application is not adapted to mobile devices (responsiveness was not required)
there are many things that I could add to this application or do better. (e.g. make a better form validation than using an alert) but I decided to keep it simple to make it easier to view the code and because no graphic design requirements were specified
